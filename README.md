system and asks the user to enter the name of an item to be added to the cart. The item will be

app system. If the item has already been added to the cart, the quantity of that item in the cart is
increased by one.
Display Cart: All the items in the cart are displayed, the system then calculates the sub-total by
calculating the total sum of the products of the price and quantity of each item in the cart (Sum
(item's price * item's quantity)). The sub-total is displayed along with the tax, which is (sub-total *
0.05), and the total, which is (sub-total + tax) for all items in the cart.
